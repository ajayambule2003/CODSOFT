Java programming some problems solutions. 

1.**This Java program implements a simple number guessing game.**
 Here's a brief summary of how it works:

Initialize Random Number: The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
User Input: It repeatedly prompts the user to guess the number.
Comparison:
If the user's guess is correct, it prints a congratulatory message and exits the loop.
If the guess is too high, it informs the user that the guess is higher than the target and asks them to guess again.
If the guess is too low, it informs the user that the guess is lower than the target and asks them to guess again.
Loop: The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
